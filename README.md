# Hero
Hero is a work-in-progress Rogue-like being developed by Jack Dacey and Cameron Nelson as part of a project for CS2311 at Landmark College. The game will be a fairly standard rogue-like with the old-fashioned 'turn-based' movement system from the original rogue, however Hero will incorporate real-time elements in it's combat.

## What currently works:
Very little. What is in development now is just an extremely basic tech demo that has no gameplay at all.

## What to expect:
This game was idealized as part of a game-design / game-story course, and is unlikely to be finished by it's original creators. We will work through the semester on it, and may return to it when it is a less stressful project in the future. If we go dark, all of the content here is free (gratis and libre) for anyone to use as they see fit.

## Who's doing what:
-The disgusting programming: Jack Dacey   
-The beautiful art: Cameron Nelson
